# experimental_methods_III

***This repository contains portfolio assignments (as a single pdf file), which were done during the experimental methods III course as part of Cognitive Science BA´s degree at Aarhus University***

***Teacher:Riccardo Fusaroli***

***Instructor: Kenneth Christian Enevoldsen***


***2019 fall semester***



## About the course

This course is about (some aspects of) how do you use statistical techniques in the real world (aka data science). It enables to master the complexity of the data: data juggling with tidyverse, generalized mixed effects linear models; timeseries analysis. Teaches how to create kick-ass generalizable and accountable models: Basic machine-learning techniques (explanation vs. prediction), model comparison, feature selection. Develops the skills necessary to build “data products”: shareable code repositories on github and meaningful analysis reports.


## Portfolio assignments

| Assignment | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Portfolio 1: Data cleaning & wrangling (data preprocessing for Portfolio 2) | Testing out the git integration with RStudio. Cleaning and transforming several data sets into just one containing only the variables that are needed for the analysis. Warming up tidyverse skills (especially the sub-packages stringr and dplyr) |
| Portfolio 2: Assessing linguistic development (in ASD) (code + report) | Developing a tool (mixed effects or multilevel models) to assess and predict language development in children |
| Portfolio 3: Automated assessment of schizophrenia through voice analysis (code + report) | Building and assessing an automated tool to “diagnose” schizophrenia from voice. Creating a logistic regression model, which can be applied as a classifier. |
| Portfolio 4: Interpersonal coordination of physiology (code + report) | Critically assessing the presence and mechanisms of interpersonal coordination. Preprocessing and modeling heart rate and respiration data |
| Portfolio 5: Meta-analysis of voice patterns in schizophrenia (code + report)| Critically collectig and organizing previous findings in a meta-analysis to guide future studies |
